# Restaurant-API

This is part of the DevSlopes course on Udemy through which I am learning about Node.js and MongoDb

Here I have developed an API for reviewing foodtrucks. Also, I have created an IOS client that uses this API to show the full functionality. Through the client, the user can review a foodtruck, find the trucks in an Area using Apple Maps and can also add a food truck thats not in the list.
